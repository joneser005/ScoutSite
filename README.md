# ScoutSite
A vehicle project for learning how to create a modern, responsive web application.

## Section One: Introduction
### Project Overview
What we want to learn?
what do we want the project to be able to do?
How to structure the flow of lessons?  For one, must jump between client and server.

### ~~Terminology section?~~
nah, they can learn as we go

### Environment setup
TODO: Have everyone use Ubuntu/VM or let them wallow around in Windows?
Python 3.6, pip, virtualenv
Django, React, database, ...


Probably won't structure it like this, but here are some key technologies we will focus on:
## Section Two: The Front End
Everything that runs on the web browser, tablet, smartphone, or other modern, capable web-enabled device.

### The Essentials
#### **HTML5** 
"HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current version of the HTML standard."

#### **CSS**
"Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects like SVG or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media."

#### **Javascript**
Code that runs on the web client to perform tasks like input validation, async I/O with the server, and other fun stuff.

### Advanced
#### **React**
"A JavaScript library for building user interfaces"


## Section Three: Back end - The Server
**Python**
> "Python is powerful... and fast; plays well with others; runs everywhere; is friendly & easy to learn; is Open."
  
  _We will be using Python 3.6+_
    
**Django**
> "The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines"

**Relational Database**

  _We will start with Sqlite3, then later learn a popular cloud-hosted implementation._
  
We'll also dig into hosting all of this in the cloud so we don't have to manage the infrastructure ourselves.  Heroku, Amazon, or Google, or maybe we'll look at these and several more.  A bridge to cross when we get here!
